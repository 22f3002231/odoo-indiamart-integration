![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This module provides a complete integration with the IndiaMART Pull API for Odoo 19 Community Edition. It automates the process of fetching new business inquiries from your IndiaMART seller account and creating them as clean, enriched leads in your Odoo CRM.

This project was built to be a robust, standalone solution for businesses looking to streamline their lead capture process from one of India's largest B2B marketplaces.

## Key Features

* **Automated Lead Sync:** A scheduled action runs every 5 minutes to automatically pull the latest leads from IndiaMART.
* **Manual Fetching:** A user-friendly wizard allows you to import leads from any specific 7-day period in the past.
* **Detailed Lead Creation:** Creates new inquiries as **Leads** (not Opportunities), allowing for a proper sales qualification workflow within the Odoo CRM.
* **Lead Enrichment:**
    * Automatically assigns an initial **Probability** based on the type of inquiry (e.g., Direct Call, Buy-Lead, WhatsApp).
    * Maps detailed information including Company Name, Full Address, Contact Info, and the specific product of interest.
    * Stores the original IndiaMART Lead Type (Direct Enquiry, PNS Call, etc.) on the lead form for clarity.
* **API Call Logging:** A dedicated menu in the Odoo UI allows you to view the history and status of every API call made, both manual and automated, making monitoring and debugging simple.
* **Duplicate Prevention:** Uses IndiaMART's unique query ID to ensure no duplicate leads are ever created in your system.
